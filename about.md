## About

I'm a bioinformatician and received my Ph.D. from Boston University under Dr. Cynthia A. Bradham. While at the Bradham lab, my work spanned variety of projects and data modalities, with an emphasis on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and confocal microscopy. While at BU I gained expertise in scRNA-seq analysis and published a novel algorithm to accurately identify cell states in mixed-condition single-cell experiments. This project provided the analytical backbone of my later work to exhaustively characterize subpopulation diversification of Primary Mesenchyme cells (PMCs) in the sea urchin _Lytechinus variegatus_ during development using scRNA-seq perturbation experiments. This project included typical molecular pattern descriptions, but also spatiotemporal descriptions of embryonic locations by convolving scRNA-seq with single-molecule FISH confocal data. For more information, please see the abstract of my [thesis](posts/2023/07/12/thesis.html).

As the only computational member of a developmental biology lab in a "maybe not so model" model organism, I wore a lot of hats and learned the ins-and-outs of variety of data sources and analytical techniques, including: bulk RNA-seq; scRNA-seq; gene-regulatory network inference, common analysis techniques in biomedical image analysis, including semantic segmentation and object identification; and the production of re-usable analysis software and pipelines.

Prior to my time at BU, I worked as a research assistant at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory providing statistical support on a variety of analyses, including proteomic and metabolomic projects. I received my Bachelor's of Science from Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah, with degrees in both Biology and Mathematics. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, exercising, and trying to convince my friends biking is actually the best way to get around Boston.
